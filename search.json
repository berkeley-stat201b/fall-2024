Previous years’ topics have included multivariate regression, or non-parametric density estimation.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course expects students to have either taken Stat 201A (“Introduction to Probability at an Advanced Level”) or to be taking it concurrently. Also assumed is multivariable calculus (at the level of Berkeley’s MATH 53) and linear algebra (at the level of Berkeley’s MATH 54).\nWe also implicitly assume basic previous experience with statistics or data analysis, e.g. confidence intervals, p-values, etc. This course goes through the rationale behind those concepts, but has only a limited amount of hands-on experience with the tools.\n\n\nTextbook\nWe will be following the content of “All of Statistics” by Larry Wasserman, Section II and parts of Section III. It is available online for free for UC Berkeley.\nHowever, at times, the content of the book is not detailed enough, so the material in lectures will fill this out. Homework and exam questions will be based on the lectures!\nAdditional useful references:\n\n”Probability and Statistics” by Morris H. DeGroot. It is detailed but still misses some modern components and depth.\n“Statistical Inference” by Casella and Berger. It is detailed and present “traditional” topics in more depth. But it lacks materials on modern topics.\n“Theoretical Statistics: Topics for a Core Course” by Robert Keener. This book is detailed and has relatively more modern topics than the Casella and Berger book.\n\nNote that the textbook for 201A is “An Intermediate Course in Probability” by Allan Gut if you are looking for probability background (you can also refer to Section I of Wasserman).\n\n\nOnline tools\nWe will use several different online services in the class that are probably familiar to you:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\nbCourses\nWe will post HWs, Solutions, Practice midterms, etc on Bcourses.\n\n\nEd Discussion\nAnnouncements, updates, and the like will also be largely through Ed Discussion. The GSI will check Ed Discussion at least once a day.\n\n\nGradescope\nGrading will all be done on gradescope. HW Assignments will be submitted directly by students to gradescope. Exams will be uploaded by the GSI and graded on Gradescope.\n\n\n\nWe suggest making use of Ed Discussion to get simpler questions and clarifications answered, and focusing on questions that need more hands-on explanations for office hours.\nYou can link to the Ed Discussion and Gradescope via bCourses – click on the navigational link on the side.",
