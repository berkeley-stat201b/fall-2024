Also assumed is multivariable calculus (at the level of Berkeley’s MATH 53) and linear algebra (at the level of Berkeley’s MATH 54).\nWe also implicitly assume basic previous experience with statistics or data analysis, e.g. confidence intervals, p-values, etc. This course goes through the rationale behind those concepts, but has only a limited amount of hands-on experience with the tools.\n\n\nTextbook\nWe will be following the content of “All of Statistics” by Larry Wasserman, Section II and parts of Section III. It is available online for free for UC Berkeley.\nHowever, at times, the content of the book is not detailed enough, so the material in lectures will fill this out. Homework and exam questions will be based on the lectures!\nAdditional useful references:\n\n”Probability and Statistics” by Morris H. DeGroot. It is detailed but still misses some modern components and depth.\n“Statistical Inference” by Casella and Berger. It is detailed and present “traditional” topics in more depth. But it lacks materials on modern topics.\n“Theoretical Statistics: Topics for a Core Course” by Robert Keener. This book is detailed and has relatively more modern topics than the Casella and Berger book.\n\nNote that the textbook for 201A is “An Intermediate Course in Probability” by Allan Gut if you are looking for probability background (you can also refer to Section I of Wasserman).\n\n\nOnline tools\nWe will use several different online services in the class that are probably familiar to you:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\nBcourses\nWe will post HWs, Solutions, Practice midterms, etc on Bcourses. Grades, announcements, updates, and the like will also be through Bcourses\n\n\nEd Discussion\nYou can link to the Ed Discussion via bcourses – clicking on the link on the side. The GSI will check Ed Discussion at least once a day.\n\n\nGradescope\nHW Assignments will be submitted to gradescope.\n\n\n\nWe suggest making use of Ed Discussion to get simpler questions and clarifications answered, and focusing on questions that need more hands-on explanations for office hours.",
