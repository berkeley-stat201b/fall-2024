We will cover the fundamentals of statistical inference, testing, and modeling, including point estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear models, large sample theory, categorical models, decision theory, and classification.
 
The course is primarily a survey of the theoretical basis for the statistical methods frequently encountered, but students will also do some implementation of the techniques on data.
